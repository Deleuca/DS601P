Example Next Steps:

Feature Engineering:
Create interaction terms between category and servings or polynomial features.
Implement dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA to focus on the most significant features.

Ensemble Approach:
Combine models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM using a Voting Classifier.

Try Advanced Models:
Use XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning through a randomized grid search to capture non-linear relationships better.
